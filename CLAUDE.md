# Code Principles

- We prefer simple, clean maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones.
- Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Self-documenting names and code. Only use additional comments when necessary.
- Small functions.
- Follow single responsibility principle in classes and functions.
- Code coverage is paramount.
